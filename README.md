###About
"A Turing machine is a hypothetical device that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. Despite its simplicity, a Turing machine can be adapted to simulate the logic of any computer algorithm, and is particularly useful in explaining the functions of a CPU inside a computer." @Wikipedia

###Notes:
* This is not a _real_ Turing machine, the tape head should stay fixed, while the tape moves...
* It does not check the correctness of any input at all.
* BUG. The head stops one step before it should.

###Why?:
It's cool ;D BTW, this grammar doesn't do anything particulary interesting. It's supposed to change all 0s to 1s and vice-versa, and place the reading head in the first element, so where it started.
